# SPADAN
SPADAN stands for Systematic Protein Association Dynamic ANalyzer which is an old name of a city in Iran!
SPADAN is a systematic pipeline developed in MATLAB that generates a large-scale ordinary differential equation model from protein interactions in a biological phenomenon by getting time-series experimental concentrations from it.
